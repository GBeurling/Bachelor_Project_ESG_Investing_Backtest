# Bachelor_Project_ESG_Investing_Backtest

#### Project Description

This thesis aimed to investigate ESG as a factor, as a long-only factor investor seeking to compose Stand-Alone, Mix or Integrated Portfolios from an asset pool consisting of S&P 100. 

We sought to utilize Python to backtest ESG as a factor (alongside Value and Growth) on S\&P 100 across an approximate 10Y period, as a component in various portfolio constructions enabling us to deconstruct its return and risk properties in comparison to more well defined factors.
